debugulator
===========

**A project by Sadie Bartholomew.**


About: Ultimate Vision
----------------------

.. note::
   
   This is the project vision, which will be implemented incrementally.


The ``debugulator`` API provides a set of methods to add in single or multiple
custom printing or logging calls, with user-defined messages including
reference to the ``str()`` or ``repr()`` of key objects, via targeting
syntactical and semantical elements of the code, including across chains
of dependent modules.

It also provides methods to remove these (or manually-added equivalents).

``debugulator`` can be used on Python 2 or 3 scripts (though Python 2 is
becoming deprecated, only simple changes are required to adapt the API from 2
to 3, so it may as well be supported).
